gwyddion (2.55-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Due to the forthcoming removal of PyGTK, the Python bindings are no
  longer built and installed.  If you have custom scripts that rely on
  them they will cease to work.

  The gwyddion-plugins package is no longer available.  All plugins are
  installed as source code examples in /usr/share/doc/gwyddion/plugins.
