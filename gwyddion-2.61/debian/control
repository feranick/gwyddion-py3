Description: Scanning Probe Microscopy visualization and analysis tool
 Gwyddion is a modular program for Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) data
 visualization and analysis. It is primarily intended for analysis of height
 field data obtained by microscopy techniques like
  * Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM),
  * Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM),
  * Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM),
  * Near-field Scanning Optical Microscopy (SNOM or NSOM)
 and others. However, it can be used for arbitrary height field and
 image analysis.
 .
 This package contains the main application and its modules. It also contains
 a GNOME (and Xfce) thumbnailer which creates previews for all file types known
 to Gwyddion.
