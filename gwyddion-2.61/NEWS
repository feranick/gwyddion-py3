  preserving absolute data values.  A Critical warning message in column
  alignment of non-square images when mask was present but ignored was fixed.
- Mark by threshold, Mark by edge detection, Facet analysis: The mask can be
  combined with mask already present on the image using union or intersection.
- Mark by threshold: Reset button now really resets all the settings.
- Colour range tool: Can reverse the mapping for fixed ranges.  Mapping range
  is no longer reset to full upon data change.
- Object synthesis: Features created on the surface can be positive, negative
  or randomly either now.
